# esx_menudefault

If you want to change alignment of the menu. Go into css at the top where says .menu{} Otherwise It will always stay on the right side as in the video.

CHANGE: 

--[[

  left: 1450;
  top: 430;
  
--]]

Also rename the file from esx_menudefault-master to "esx_menudefault" - I've kept It like that for years and cannot be bothered to add the _ hahaha.. but If you would like to rename It. It is up to you **I do not own this script!**
